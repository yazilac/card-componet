## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

My name is Yazmin and I am passionate about programming.
 Here I present the solution to a challenge.

## About the challenge


Your challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## Challenge
This challenge was completed according to the FRONTEND MENTOR challenge. 
To create it you need HTML, and CSS is quite basic and helps to practice web design.
